# 🔍 EDA: Sierra Leone Solar Data

This project includes exploratory data analysis of solar energy and environmental variables in Sierra Leone.

The goal of the EDA is to:

   -  Understand solar irradiation levels across different regions
   -  Examine weather and atmospheric factors affecting solar energy production
   -  Identify patterns and insights that support future solar investment strategy

## Key Steps in the EDA: 

   - Loaded and cleaned the dataset
   - Checked for missing values and handled inconsistencies
   - Visualized temperature, humidity, solar irradiance, and related trends
   - Generated summary statistics and correlation analysis
   - Identified potential opportunities for solar deployment

## Outputs:
